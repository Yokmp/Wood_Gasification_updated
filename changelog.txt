Version: 4.2.1
Date: 2025-02-06
  Changes:
    - fixed max probability range setting
    - changed order of the greenhouse to sit next to the agricultural tower
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.0
Date: 2025-01-25
  Changes:
    - Now requires base >= 2.0.7, which automatically updates all technology effects on mod
      configuration changed.
    - Created startup settings for greenhouse output rate of wood, yumako fruits and jellynuts.
    - Changed seed drop probability setting to use floating numbers. Now also allows for values
      higher than 1 by increasing upper bound of value range and then fine-adjusting probability.
    - Improved criteria for deciding which tree types should drop seeds (normal and planted trees;
      sugar canes and dead/dry trees will no longer drop them!). Reduced conflict with other mods.
    - Tidied up criteria for greenhouse tech unlocks. Tech can now always be researched after
      discovery of Gleba, but Gleba setting disables unlocking it earlier.
    - Wood recipe using wood now only available if Space Age is not installed.
    - Reordered greenhouse recipes.
    - Tidied up a bit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 4.1.0
Date: 2024-11-16
  Changes:
    - the greenhouse working visuals should work now
    - you can now plant seeds
    - punching some poor trees will get you seeds, sometimmes
    - if space-age is enabled, the setting to use Gleba is on by default
    - Jelly and Yumako produktion/yield is less than half of what a planting tower would get you so you can use the greenhouse but its not as cheaty
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.0.1
Date: 2024-11-13
  Changes:
    - the greenhouse can now be researched under agriculture if space-age is enabled

Version: 3.1.0
Date: 2020-11-26
  Changes:
    - Updated for Faction 1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.0.0
Date: 2020-11-26
  Changes:
    - Updated for Faction 1.0
    - Made the recipes easier since wood is early game and people install this mod on purpose
  Rebalancing:
    - Wood gasification costs 50 automation science (simple to research)
    - Wood gasification of bitumen to oil costs 100 automation and logistic science (it's simple science, but hard to perfect)
    - Advanced wood gasification costs 400 automation and logistic science (wood-to-oil easy-mode will take some effort)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.5.0
Date: 2020-03-18
  Changes:
    - Added Spanish, Italian and Portuguese translations using Deepl.com
    - Changed some Dutch translations
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed my broken changelog (I REALLY need automated tests and a changelog linter for these factorio mods)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.4.0
Date: 2020-03-14
  Changes:
    - Added Polish and French translations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.3.0
Date: 2020-02-06
  Rebalancing:
    - Wood gasification costs 100 automation and logistic science (reasonably simple to research)
    - Wood gasification of bitumen to oil costs 400 automation and logistic science (it's simple science, but hard to perfect)
    - Advanced wood gasification costs 150 automation, logistic and chemical science (wood-to-oil easy-mode will take some effort)
    - Wood gasification uses 10 wood to produce 20 petroleum gas and 8 bitumen (80% efficient)
    - Wood gasification enables you to convert 32 bitumen into 1 solid fuel (75% efficient)
    - Advanced bitumen processing uses 32 bitumen and 200 water to produce 40 crude oil (90% efficient (crude oil takes another efficiency hit during refining))
    - Advanced wood gasification uses 20 wood and 200 water to produce 15 heavy oil, 15 light oil and 30 petroleum gas (90% efficient)
  Changes:
    - Changed the text string of Tar into Diluted Bitumen to be somewhat more scientifically correct, internally it's all still 'tar' for brevity.
    - Added bitumen processing to crude oil using bitumen upgrading so you can turn wood into crude oil
    - Added wood-gasification-to-oil as a new researchable technology after advanced wood gasification
    - Updated the balancing.xls to show the calculations behind the wood-gasification-to-oil recipe
    - Updated the source.psd after creating the graphics for the new wood-gasification-to-oil recipe and technology
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wood (and water) showing up as raw product for other oil-related products (this should be crude oil, not wood)
    - Fixed the graphics by removing the coal that was still in there from older versions
  Notes:
    - Just FYI: this version of the mod still works with 0.17.x
  Broke:
    - The Russian and German translations probably need work since I used Google translate for the new tech.
    - I tried not to break too much, but your wood processing setups probably need some love and attention.
