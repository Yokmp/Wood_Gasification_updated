# Mods: Factorio: Wood Gasification

This is the repository for the Wood Gasification mod for Factorio.

Too much wood? No oil on your map? Want petroleum gas, solid fuel or crude oil? Then this mod's for you!

Wood gasification is the process of turning wood into it's carbohydrate constituents and releasing its chemical potential in the form of several oil products: petroleum gas, diluted bitumen, which can be converted to crude oil.

Wood gasification comes in two flavors: Wood gas processing uses a chemical lab to turn 10 units of wood into 20 units of petroleum gas and 8 units of diluted bitumen. 32 units of diluted bitumen can be turned into 1 unit of solid fuel. With some further research, you can turn 32 diluted bitumen and 200 water into 40 crude oil. At a higher research level, you'll have advanced wood gasification processes that uses a refinery to turn 20 wood and 200 water into 15 units of heavy oil, 15 units of light oil and 30 petroleum gas. This mod is meant to kick-start your chemical plants (or when you have a shortage of crude oil OR a surplus of wood on your map)

## Excellent artwork was created by snouz
A pull request was submitted on github which I managed to miss for a year and a half. It has been finally included. My apologies for this oversight! The addition of the new artwork was released as version 3.2.0

## Continuation of unmaintained mod

This mod is an update for the 0.14 mod 'Wood Gas' which was discontinued; It's my attempt to upgrade 'Wood Gas' (0.14 only) to 0.15+ and continue the development of the mod. The original author ('mooklepticon') of 'Wood Gas' has given me his blessing to continue this mod.

## Translators wanted

I would love to be able to support even more languages like Spanish, Portugese, Italian, Japanese and maybe some slavic languages and perhaps even Hungarian or Finnish?. If you would like to help, please take a look at the repository, or if you don't know how to do that Github thing, just contact me via <https://mods.factorio.com/> and I'll add your translated strings from the locale-file to the mods' repository.

## TLDR

This mod processes wood into oil products.

- Early game: Wood in Chemical plant creates Petroleum Gas & Diluted Bitumen. Diluted Bitumen & Water in Chemical plant produces either Crude Oil or Solid Fuel
- Later game: Wood in Refinery creates Heavy Oil, Light Oil & Petroleum Gas directly.
